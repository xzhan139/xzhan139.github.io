      dynamics and control problems in <b>soft biological systems</b>. I particularly focus on 
      revealing mechanisms, through which soft slender-bodied animals can combine <b>embodied control principles</b> and 
      <b>neural sensory and feedback</b> to achieve complex motion behaviors. </p>

    <p align="justify", style="width: 25%;">To obtain a mechanistic understanding of soft biological systems,
      I started by establishing a . </p>  


To elucidate underlying control and behavioral strategies, a mechanistic
understanding is thus required. However, this is often hindered by experimental complexities as well
as by the lack of modeling techniques able to appropriately capture the nonlinear, heterogeneous, and
anisotropic nature of biological constituents, and their dynamic interaction.
To address this gap, I have established a computational framework for the modeling and simulation
of complex musculoskeletal architectures[4]. This framework pioneers the use of one-dimensional,
elastic slender body assemblies (via Cosserat rods theory) to construct active, heterogeneous, and threedimensional
biological layouts, striking a balance between computational efficiency, modeling accuracy
and scalability. I have demonstrated the utility of this approach across biophysical scenarios, scales, and
environment, from human joints to full-scale aquatic, terrestrial and aerial creatures
