    <p >I combine computational and experimental approaches to investigate 
      dynamics and control problems in <b>soft biological systems</b>. I particularly focus on 
      revealing mechanisms, through which soft slender-bodied animals can combine <b>embodied control principles</b> and 
      <b>neural sensory and feedback</b> to achieve complex motion behaviors. </p>
    <h1>Modeling Musculoskeletal Systems</h1>
    <p>To obtain a mechanistic understanding of soft biological systems,
      I started by establishing a computational framework for the modeling and simulation of complex musculoskeletal architectures. 
      This framework pioneers the use of one-dimensional, elastic slender body assemblies (via Cosserat rods theory)
      to construct active, heterogeneous, and three-dimensional biological layouts. I have demonstrated the utility of this approach across biophysical scenarios, scales, and
      environment, from human joints to full-scale aquatic, terrestrial and aerial creatures. </p>
