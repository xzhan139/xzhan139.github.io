    <p text-align: justify;>I combine computational and experimental approaches to investigate 
      dynamics and control problems in **soft biological systems**. I particularly focus on 
      revealing mechanisms, through which soft slender-bodied animals can combine **embodied control principles** and 
      **neural sensory and feedback** to achieve complex motion behaviors. </p>
