    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I combine computational and experimental approaches to investigate 
      dynamics and control problems in soft biological systems. I particularly focus on 
      revealing how soft slender-bodied animals combine embodied control principles and 
      neural sensory and feedback to achieve complex motion behaviors. </p>
