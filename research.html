    <p align="justify", style="width: 25%;">I combine computational and experimental approaches to investigate 
      dynamics and control problems in <b>soft biological systems</b>. I particularly focus on 
      revealing mechanisms, through which soft slender-bodied animals can combine <b>embodied control principles</b> and 
      <b>neural sensory and feedback</b>b> to achieve complex motion behaviors. </p>
